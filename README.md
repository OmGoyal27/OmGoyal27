Hi, I’m @OmGoyal27.

I’m interested in fun coding projects.

I’m currently learning python and want to learn cpp and sql next.
Fun fact: I wanted to learn coding/programming just because I wanted to open the world of infinite creations!

## About me

Name - Om Goyal

Hobbies - Just code and code (Yes I am serious)

## Why learn coding?

I wanted to solve those little computer/tech problems that occur in our day to day life ranging from the tiniest copy and paste to automating functions.

And now I want it to be my full-time fun!
